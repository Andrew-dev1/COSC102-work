What do these two code snippets tell you about Java math?:

It follows PEMDAS order of operation, and any inclusion of 
doubles automatically changes to the math to doubles math. 
Truncation still going on in java. 




2.2.2)
Improvement #1:

The checking of the number against the low and high can be shortened
to one if-else check. 


Improvement #2:

The print lines do not have to be seperated from the first if-else
statement. It can be included in the one if-else line and therefore
the variable TheVariable is not needed. 





2.2.4)
Describe FOUR of the errors you corrected

Error #1:

I changed (ch1 == (ch2 + 1) || (ch2 - 1)) to (ch1 == (ch2 + 1) || ch1 == (ch2 - 1))
because you need two seperate boolean expressions. The or 
operator can't compare two values. 

Error #2:

elif -> else if. Elif is python while else if is java,
and I deleted the ; at the end of that line

Error #3:

I fixed the else statement because it should not have a 
conditional and added brackets

Error #4

I fixed the print statement by changing the commas for +. 
Java interprets each comma as a seperator and thus multiple 
values for the print statement, which only accepts one value.






2.2.5)
Why did this syntax error occur and how did you fix it?:

this syntax error occured because the variables were initialized inside the 
conditionals, so they were local variables that can not be accessed in the main stack.





2.3.1)
Did your card access work?  Any issues?:




Yes it worked 


2.3.2)
One aspect of Java syntax you have found challenging and/or interesting thus far:

The syntax is not very challenging, but the structure is 
a bit annoying to complete compared to python. 





2.3.3)
What is one interesting detail about yourself?:
   
A future goal of mine is to teach myself about money and 
retire my parents by the time I am 30.
